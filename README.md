## Description

React-Quizzical is an online trivia game. Each game asks the user five questions, each of which has four possible answers. After the user submits their responses, their responses turn green if the user is correct, or red if the user is incorrect (and the correct answer highlights green). Subsequently, the user is allowed to start a new game. The app is built using React, React Context for app-wide state management, and the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/) to fetch the trivia answers/questions.
